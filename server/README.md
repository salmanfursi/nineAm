<!-- # MERN Stack Shop Auth Backend

## Overview

This is the backend for a MERN stack app with user authentication, global shop name uniqueness, and cross-subdomain session support.

---

## Features

- User signup with username, password, and 3+ unique shop names
- Password validation (min 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special char)
- Global uniqueness for shop names
- User login with "Remember Me" (7 days) or 30 min session
- JWT authentication via HTTP-only cookies
- Profile/dashboard with shop list and logout
- Shop-specific dashboard with subdomain support (e.g., http://beautyhub.localhost:5173)
- Cross-subdomain authentication (cookie shared on all \*.localhost)

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Create a `.env` file** (see `.env.example` for required variables)
4. **Start the server**
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Auth

- `POST /api/auth/signup` — Signup (username, password, shops[])
- `POST /api/auth/signin` — Login (username, password, rememberMe)
- `GET /api/auth/profile` — Get user profile (requires auth)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — Logout

### Shops

- `GET /api/shops` — List all shops
- `GET /api/shop/:shopname` — Verify shop ownership (requires auth)

---

## Usage Notes

- All protected routes require the JWT cookie set by login/signup.
- Shop names must be unique across all users.
- Passwords must be strong (see validation rules above).
- For cross-subdomain auth, set `COOKIE_DOMAIN=.localhost` in `.env`.

---

## HTTPS for Local Testing

- To test with `secure: true` and `sameSite: "none"`, you must run your backend and frontend with HTTPS.
- Use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate local SSL certificates.
- Update your dev server configs to use these certs.

## Example .env

```
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.localhost
```

### 🛠️ Suggested Improvements (Optional but Pro)

* ✅ Rename `"john_doe"` in test 9 to an actual registered user like `"user1"` or `"user3"` (since `john_doe` is not in your signup list).
* ✅ Group `user1`, `user2`, `user3` payloads as **separate signup requests**, not merged in one JSON.

  ```json
  // One at a time ⛔️ not:
  {
    "username": "...",
    "password": "...",
    ...
  }
  {
    "username": "...",
    ...
  }
  ```

### ✅ Final Verdict

You’ve done a clean, structured, and complete job ✅
Keep this as part of your **README** or **API testing doc** for submission.

Let me know when you're ready to implement the frontend (subdomain auth + dashboard).
